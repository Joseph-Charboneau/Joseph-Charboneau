- Hi, I’m @Joseph-Charboneau
- I’m interested in cybersecurity and machine learning, along with software development.
- My main skills lie in C++, but I am currently learning Python, HTML, and Javascript on the side.
- Currently working on a One Rep Max Calulator in C++, which takes input from the user and calculates their max weight for one repition on bench, squat, or deadlift.
  My hope is to also compare the user to a standard lift and display their percentile relative to their gender and weight.
